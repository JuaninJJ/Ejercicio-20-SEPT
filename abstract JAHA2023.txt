Breast cancer is the most important women's cancer worldwide by its incidence and mortality, in which triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the type with the worst clinical outcome and has fewer therapeutic alternatives in comparison to other breast cancer types.  GK-1 is a peptide that in the experimental model of the metastatic 4T1 breast cancer has demonstrated anti-tumor and anti-metastatic properties.  Herein, GK-1 (5 mg/kg, i.v.) weekly administrated decreases tumor growth and the number of lung macro-metastases and lung and lymph nodes micro-metastases. Histological analysis reveals that GK-1 reduced 57% of the intra-tumor vascular areas, diminished the leukemoid reaction's progression, and the spleens' weight and length. A significant reduction in VEGF-C, SDF-1, angiopoietin-2, and endothelin-1 angiogenic factors was induced. Moreover, GK-1 prevents T cell exhaustion in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) decreasing PD-1 expression. It also increased IFN-Î³ and granzyme-B expression and the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ TILs cells against tumor cells. All these effects are associated with a better antitumor response and a better prognosis.
